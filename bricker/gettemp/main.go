This is a example to get the actual temperature from the Temperature Bricklet
and print it on the command line.
This is a very simple example.
It should only show the basic structure of a implementation with the bricker api.

To run this example, you should have a Temperature Bricklet and a connection to it
(USB, Ethernet, WLAN) with a running brickd.
This example does not test, if the bricklet exists.
When no bricklet exists it waits forever.

You need the bricker api code.
